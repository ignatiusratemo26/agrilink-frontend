AgriLink: AI-Powered Crop Recommendations and Web3-Enabled Marketplace for African Farmers
AgriLink is a data-driven agricultural platform developed to empower African farmers through personalized crop recommendations, direct access to buyers, and secure Web3-enabled payments. By integrating machine learning, AgriLink analyzes soil and climate data to recommend optimal crops, boosting productivity and sustainability.
The platform has an online marketplace where farmers list produce and negotiate contracts with buyers. To reduce fraud and build trust, we leverage the Ethereum blockchain to power decentralized escrow-based payments, allowing funds to be securely held and released only upon delivery confirmation.
AgriLink also includes a learning portal to support farmer collaboration and continuous education.
Focusing on scalability, transparency, and local empowerment, AgriLink shows how AI and blockchain can be harnessed to solve real-world problems in agriculture while promoting economic growth in Africa.
